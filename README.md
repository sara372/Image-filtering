## Features
1-A GUI to allow the user to browse for images (grayscale and RGB), choose a filter and show the output.

2-Filter examples (low pass, median, high pass, la placian).

3-Apply the filter in both spatial and frequency domains.

4-You are required to apply four different filters.

5-Implement histogram equalization without libraries.
